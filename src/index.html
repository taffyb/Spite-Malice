			<li>The object is to be the first player to move all your cards
				from the stack on the left (your play stack) to the centre stacks.</li>
			<li>Each turn begins with 5 cards in your hand.</li>
			<li>The first card on a centre stack must be an Ace and then in
				ascending order up to the King. The card may come from your hand,
				one of your 4 discard piles or your play stack.</li>
			<li>Before you can discard, you must have at least 1 card on
				each of the 4 discard piles.</li>
			<li>Your turn ends when you "discard" - you play a card from
				your hand to 1 of the 4 discard piles.</li>
			<li>Only the top card of a discard pile is available for play.</li>
			<li>Jokers are wild and can be used as any card.</li>
			<li>If you play all 5 cards from your hand before discarding,
				you will recieve 5 more and your turn continues.
